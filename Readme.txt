Hello World!
Although I have used github a lot in the recent years, I am a new mmebr now and I really like it! 
I hope this space help me to improve my intersts to coding and I develop the skillset needed to have better results at my research and job.
I do have a very diverse background in engineering and science. 
Let's see where to go from now on!
